                <p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has triggered a gender controversy at March Madness, also know as the the NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournament.</p>

                <p>It came to light after Ali Kershner, a performance coach at Stanford, shared an image on Instagram showing the difference between the gyms provided to men’s and women’s basketball players at March Madness.</p>
                
                <br>

                <br>

                <p>While the men's gym was well equipped with equipments ranging from bars, plates, racks, dumbbells to a very spacious floor, the women's gym consists of only a rack of light weight dumbbells and some yoga mats.</p>

                <p>Kershner wrote on her instagram post, “Not usually one for this type of post but this deserves attention,”</p>

                <p>“This is the NCAA Men’s Basketball tournament vs. Women’s Basketball tournament bubble set up.</p>

                <p>“This needs to be addressed. These women want and deserve to be given the same opportunities.</p>

                <p>“Not only that – 3 weeks in a bubble and no access to DBs (dumbbells) above 30 (pounds) until the sweet 16? In a year defined by a fight for equality this is a chance to have a conversation and get better.”</p>
                
                The NCAA commented that there were “limited space”.

                <p>NCAA’s vice president of women’s basketball Lynn Holzman said, “We acknowledge that some of the amenities teams would typically have access to have not been as available inside the controlled environment,”</p>

                <p>“In part, this is due to the limited space and the original plan was to expand the workout area once additional space was available later in the tournament. However, we want to be responsive to the needs of our participating teams, and we are actively working to enhance existing resources at practice courts, including additional weight training equipment.”</p>

                <p>The excuse was quickly shot down by Oregon player Sedona Prince, who took a video of the gym to show how much space was unused.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Many people argued that the revenue the men's tournament brings in surpasses that of what the women's tournament brings, hence it is expected that the quality of gym differs.</p>
                
                <p>Basketball is supposed to bring people with differences together and not apart. We must never bring the issue of gender inequality into the basketball community.</p>
