                <p>Dribbling is the most fundamental skill every basketballer should master. Without dribbling, you won't be able to move about on the court. It is also an essential skill to get past yours defenders and make your way to the basket.</p>
                
                <p>Here are 3 dribbling drills you can do at home to improve your basketball handling skills.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Yo-yo Dribble Drill</h2>
                <img src="img/dribbling2.jpg" alt="Steps to do the yo-yo dribble drill" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">Yo-yo dribble drill. (Image taken from www.online-basketball-drills.com)</p>
                
                <p>First up is the yo-yo dribble drill. The yo-yo dribble drill is a basic drill that all basketballers must know. The yo-yo dribble drill is usually used as a warm-up for the more experienced basketballers. It can help to improve your ball control, which is how well you can keep the ball within your hands.</p>
                
                <p>To do the yo-yo dribble drill, start off by dribbling the ball with your right hand, dribbling it in front of you, and placing your left hand behind your back.</p>
                    
                <p>Dribble the ball in a sideways motion, from left to right and back to left. Continue the dribbling motion for 30 seconds.</p>
                
                <p>After 30 seconds, switch the ball to your left hand and repeat the yo-yo dribble drill.</p>
                
                <p>Continue the drill until you finish at least 3 sets for each hand.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Two Ball Rapid Dribble Drill</h2>
                <img src="img/dribbling3.jpg" alt="Steps to do the two ball rapid dribble drill" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">Two ball rapid dribble drill. (Image taken from www.online-basketball-drills.com)</p>
                
                <p>Next is the two ball rapid dribble drill. The two ball rapid dribble drill can help to improve your dribbling strength as well as your hands coordination.</p>
                    
                <p>Improving your dribbling strength will help you to dribble the ball faster, which makes it harder for your opponent to steal the ball away from you. Improving your hands coordination will allow your non-dribbling hand to be more active, which can be useful when it comes to defending the ball from your opponent while dribbling.</p>
                
                <p>To do the two ball rapid dribble drill, you need two basketballs.</p>
                
                <p>Start off by dribbling one ball in each hand, dribbling it in front of you. Dribble the balls in a synchronised motion below your knee level for 10 seconds.</p>
                
                <p>Then, dribble the ball alternately, this time above your knee level, for 10 seconds.</p>
                
                <p>Continue the drill until you finish at least 5 sets. You can increase the difficulty of the drill by using more strength to dribble the balls after each set.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Figure 8 Dribble Drill</h2>

                <p>Finally, we have the figure 8 dribble drill. The figure 8 dribble drill may be a challenge for beginners, but it is an excellent drill to include in your training. It helps you to improve your ball control even if your eyes are not on the ball!</p>
                
                <p>To do the figure 8 drill, start off by dribbling the ball in front of you with your left hand.</p>
                
                <p>Dribble the ball around your left leg in the anti-clockwise direction and get the ball in between your legs.</p>
                
                <p>Receive the ball with your right hand and continue dribbling it around your right leg in the clockwise direction.</p>
                
                <p>Receive the ball in between your legs with your left hand to complete the figure 8.</p>
                
                <p>Continue the drill until you complete at least 10 sets of figure 8.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Hope these dribbling drills can help you improve your ball handling skills. Who knows, you may become one of the best ball handlers in your neighbourhood!</p>
