<h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <ul>
        <p>The essential story being told by my site revolves around the topic of basketball. Content ranges from basketball news, basketball drills to basketball tips. I chose to implement the hierarchical model structure for my site.</p>
    </ul>

<h4>3 things that have inspired me when creating my website:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The theme of my website is monochrome, where the entire website is designed to be in black and white, as well as different shades of grey.</p>
        
        <p>I was inspired by the National Basketball Association (NBA) televising their first game in black and white back in the 1950s, when coloured televisions were not invented yet.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report1.jpg" width="40%" height="200px">
        
        <img src="img/report2.jpg" width="40%" height="200px">
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The look of my website is neat and simple, with different content placed in a card. A card is a division block that has a different background colour from the body of the website.</p>
        
        <p>I was inspired by Vogue magazine's simplistic website, where its homepage consists of only a huge main article with its title and an image, as well as other side articles placed in cards with their corresponding title and image.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report3.jpg" width="33%" height="200px">
        
        <img src="img/report4.jpg" width="33%" height="200px">
        
        <img src="img/report5.jpg" width="33%" height="200px">
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The content of my website include not only news of basketball games, but also news that may be related to basketball.</p>
        
        <p>I was inspired by a piece of article on gender controversy in a college basketball tournament in the United States of America, which I have included in my news page. Most basketball related websites contain only news on basketball games, such as those of NBA, and usually neglect other news that may be of importance to the basketball community as well. The gender controversy news is an example of such neglected news as it was not widely covered in medias that are related to basketball.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>3 ways in which my site is accessible:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The images on my site contains alt texts. This will make my site accessible to blind users and users with very poor vision.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report6.jpg" width="50%" height="20px">
            
        <p>This group of users often use a screen reader to browse the internet, so having alt texts in my images will allow screen readers to describe the image to the users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The colour contrast between the texts of my site's content and the background of my site is very high. This will make my site accessible to users with visual impairments, such as those with reduced contrast sensitivty.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report7.jpg" width="30%" height="180px">
        
        <p>This group of users often have difficulty reading texts on backgrounds with very low colour contrast. With a high colour contrast between the texts of my site content and the background of my of my site, the texts will be more readable for these users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The font sizes for the texts of my site's content are relatively large and they are also resizeable on devices and browsers. This will make my site accessible to users with poor visions, such as those with presbyopia.</p>
        
        <p>This group of users often have difficulty reading texts with very small fonts. With the texts on my site being relatively large and also resizeable, these users can adjust the size of the texts on their devices and browsers to make it more readable.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>3 ways in which I have considered usability in my site:</h4>

 <ol>
     <li>
         <p>Since my site is based on the hierarchical model structure, I included a navigation bar at the top of my site on every page. I also included back buttons to bring users back to the parent page. For example, I included a "Back to News" button at the bottom of every news article page to bring users back to the news page, which is the parent page of all the news article pages.</p>
         
         <img src="img/report8.jpg" width="50%" height="30px">
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="img/report9.jpg" width="30%" height="200px">
         
         <p>This will allow users to easily navigate through my site and access every content at my site with ease.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>All the content on my site are sectioned using a card, as mentioned previously, which is a division block that has a different background colour from the body of the site.</p>
         
         <img src="img/report5.jpg" width="40%" height="220px">
         
         <p>This will allow users to easily identify the different sections and content it hold.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
         <p>My site is responsive as it can be displayed on devices and browsers of different sizes. The sizes of the texts and images, as well as the layout of my site, will change according to the size of the device or browser.</p>
         
         <p>For example, the navigation bar will be horizontal when browsed on a laptop, but will switch to vertical when browsed on a mobile phone.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report8.jpg" width="50%" height="30px">
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/report18.jpg" width="30%" height="200px">
     </li>
</ol>

<h4>3 things I had to learn/find out by myself when creating my site:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>I had to find out how to add a horizontal navigation bar with a menu list that takes up the full width of the navigation bar to my site.</p>
        
        <p>I learnt how to add a horizontal navigation bar on W3Schools. However, the menu lists of the horizontal navigation bars taught on W3Schools do not take up the full width of the navigation bar.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report11.jpg" width="50%" height="40px">
        
        <p>To fill up the empty space, I had to set the width of each list to 20%, such that all the lists takes up 100% of the navigation bar's width.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report8.jpg" width="50%" height="30px">
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/report12.jpg" height="80px">
        
        <p>In addition to that, I learnt how to change the colour of a block when a cursor hovers over it. I also changed the colour of the navigation bar to fit the monochrome theme of my site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I had to learn how to embed YouTube videos on my site's content.</p>
        
        <p>I learnt how to embed YouTube videos on my site's content on W3Schools. I learnt to use the iframe element with the src attribute inside. The video will be embedded on my site after I insert the URL link to the YouTube video in the src attribute.</p>
        
        <p>I had to change the width and height of the embedded videos so that they can fit nicely on my site.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report13.jpg" width="70%" height="60px">
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/report20.jpg" width="40%" height="250px">
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I had to learn how to add collapsible content to my site.</p>
        
        <p>I learnt how to add collapsible content on W3Schools. However, the collapsible content taught on W3Schools starts off as an opened content, and collapses after a user clicks on it.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report14.jpg" width="60%" height="120px">
        
        <img src="img/report15.jpg" width="60%" height="60px">
        
        <p>To make my collapsible content start off as a closed content and opens when a user clicks on it, I referenced some codes from W3Schools where they teach users how to make an accordion. I adapted some code from the accordion code to my collapsible content code to make it work.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report16.jpg" width="60%" height="100px">
        
        <img src="img/report17.jpg" width="60%" height="180px">
        
        <p>I changed the width and height of the collapsible content so that they can fit nicely on my site. I also changed the colour of the collapsible content so that it fits the monochrome theme of my site.</p>       
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Aspects of my work that I think worked well:</h4>

    <ul>
        <p>Firstly, I think the card for the content of my site worked well because different content are sectioned clearly with the card.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report5.jpg" width="40%" height="220px">
        
        <p>Secondly, I think the design of my site worked well because it is responsive. My site can be displayed on devices and browsers of different sizes. The sizes of the texts and images, as well as the layout of my site, will change according to the size of the device or browser.</p>
        
        <p>For example, as mentioned previously, the navigation bar will be horizontal when browsed on a laptop, but will switch to vertical when browsed on a mobile phone.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report8.jpg" width="50%" height="30px">
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/report18.jpg" width="30%" height="200px">
        
        <p>Lastly, I think the collapsible content for my news, drills and tips page worked well because it makes my site look neat and concise. Even if more articles were to be added to those pages, the page will still look organised.</p>
        
        <img src="img/report19.jpg" width="60%" height="200px">
    </ul>

<h4>Aspects of my work that could be improved:</h4>

    <ul>
        <p>Firstly, I could have used more JavaScript on my site to make my site more interactive and fun. For example, I can add basketball related animations to the menus on the navigation bar and to the buttons on my site. However, as the current look of my site is based on simplicity, I decided not to complicate the menus and buttons.</p>
        
        <p>Secondly, I could have added a search bar on my site to make it easier for users to search for content. A search bar is very useful if the site is content heavy. However, as there are only five articles on my site, adding a search bar would be very redundant.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly, I could have added paginations on my news, drills and tips pages so that my articles would not cluster in one page. A pagination is useful if a page is content heavy and needs more page to hold the content. However, similar to the aforementioned situation, there are only five articles on my site, so adding paginations to my news, drills and tips pages would be very redundant as well.</p>
    </ul>
