                <p>Have you ever had days where you just don't make any shots no matter how you shoot it? We have all been there.</p>
                
                <p>Here are 3 shooting drills you can do to improve your shooting.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Underbasket Drill</h2>
                <img src="img/shooting2.jpg" alt="Steps to do the underbasket drill" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">Underbasket drill.</p>
                
                <p>First is the underbasket drill. The underbasket drill is the most basic shooting drill in basketball. How can you have a further range if you can't even make an underbasket shot, right?</p>
                
                <p>With reference to the figure above, start off at point 1 and take an underbasket shot.</p>
                
                <p>If you score, take the ball and move on to point 2 to take another underbasket shot. If you score again, go back to point 1 and repeat the drill.</p>
                
                <p>If you miss, take the rebound and try again at point 1 until you score.</p>
                
                <p>Continue taking shots until you score at least 50 balls.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>A-B-C Drill</h2>
                <img src="img/shooting3.jpg" alt="Steps to do the A-B-C drill" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">A-B-C Drill.</p>
                
                <p>Next is the A-B-C drill. The A-B-C drill is a good drill to train your mid-range shots.</p>
                
                <p>With reference to the figure above, start off at point 1 and take your shot.</p>
                
                <p>If you score, take the ball and move on to point 2.</p>
                
                <p>However, if you miss, take the rebound and try again at point 1 until you score.</p>
                
                <p>Continue taking shots and progress as you score at each point. The drill is considered complete after you score the last ball at point 9.</p>
                
                <p>To make the drill more fun and interesting, you can compete with your friends in a game of A-B-C shootout.</p>
                
                <p>Only one person should be shooting at anytime in the game of A-B-C shootout. If that person scores, he will continue to the next point to take his shot. If he misses, he will have to pass the ball on to his friend so that his friend can have his turn. Whoever scores the last ball at point 9 wins the game of A-B-C.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Starfish Drill</h2>
                <img src="img/shooting4.jpg" alt="Steps to do the starfish drill" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">Starfish drill.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, we have the starfish drill. Beginners may find the starfish drill difficult because it may be out of their usual shooting range. It is a good drill to train your 3-point shots.</p>
                
                <p>With reference to the figure above, start off at point 1 and take your shot.</p>
                
                <p>Shoot the ball 5 times at point 1, disregarding whether you score or miss.</p>
                
                <p>After completing your 5 shots at point 1, move on to point 2 and take another 5 shots.</p>
                
                <p>Continue taking shots and progress to the next point after taking 5 shots at each point. The drill is considered complete after you shoot the ball 5 times at point 5, disregarding whether you score or miss.</p>
                
                <p>Calculate the number of balls you scored out of the 25 shots you took, and try to improve your score on the next set.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Hope these shooting drills can help you improve your shots, and maybe also help you on your journey to become the hotshot of your neighbourhood!</p>
