                <p>Shooting a basketball is a difficult art to master, but with these tips, you will become a sharpshooter in no time.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Hold the ball at your comfort level</h2>
                <img src="img/shootingtip2.jpg" alt="A man holding a basketball" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">A man holding a basketball. (Photo taken from basketballknowledgefacts.blogspot.com)</p>
                
                <p>Different people will tell you to hold the basketball differently. However, the best way to hold the ball is to actually hold it the way you feel you're most comfortable with.</p>
                
                <p>From there, you can adjust your shots to suit the way you hold your ball.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Don't set your shots over your head</h2>
                <img src="img/shootingtip3.jpg" alt="A basketball player taking a shot over his head" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">A basketball player taking a shot over his head. (photo taken from www.hoopsbeast.com)</p>
                
                <p>Yes, most of the best shooters set their shots over their head, but don't forget they are professional basketballers.</p>
                
                <p>Setting your shots over your head will cause your shots to be less accurate because you will need to use more strength to shoot the ball.</p>
                
                <p>To become more accurate while using less strength, try to set your shots at your eye level. This will minimise the strength you need to shoot the ball, allowing your shots to be more accurate.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Bend your wrist as far back as you can</h2>
                <img src="img/shootingtip4.jpg" alt="A man holding a basketball with his wrist bent" width="100%" height="200px">
                <p class="newsimgcaption">A man holding a basketball with his wrist bent (photo taken from daniellerosehlpe3531.blogspot.com)</p>
                
                <p>Bending your wrist as far back as you can when shooting will help you increase the power in your shots. It will also give your shots a good arc, which increases the chance of the ball going in to the basket as it drops at an approximate 45 degree angle.</p>
                
                <p>This will require many months of practice as you need to get the muscle memory of your wrist to get used to bending as far back as you can.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Be confident</h2>
                <p>As cliché as it may sound, having confidence in your shots will help you shoot better because your muscle memory will not be affected by other factors.</p>
                
                <p>Always be confident when taking your shots, even if it means having a defender up on your face.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Hope these shooting tips can help you shoot better. Keep shooting, because you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.</p>
